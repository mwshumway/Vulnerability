Given a dynamical system (A, B), how do you represent the vulnerability of each node to a cyber-physical attack? Which node is the most vulnerable? 
Considered from a security "game" perspective, which node should the defender "hide" or protect the most in order to minimize the damage from a potential attacker?

These are some of the research questions that I think about in my research at IDeA labs at BYU with Dr. Sean Warnick and Dr. David Grimsman.

Coded in matlab, this code performs necessary vulnerability analyses to answer such questions and help in our research of generalizing results. 

Normally, I would code in Python, but Matlab's control library had what we needed for this project.
